Therefore, the HPO team will adjust the terms and structure as required by the rules of ontology engineering.</p> <p>We then use the hpo2gforms app to create Google questionnaires for the terms that were worked on during the workshops.

Please do not add comments if you completely approve of the term and all of its components. Instead, use the radio buttons. We will use a Python script to evaluate all of the results and will count a term as \"Accepted\" if the participant chooses the \"Accept\" option or the \"n/a\" option for all components and has selected \"Accept\" for at least \"Term label\".</p> <p>If you choose \"Reject\" for any component of a term, we will count your answer as \"Reject\" the entire term.

Unless otherwise agreed upon, we will count a term as \"Accept in principle\" if at least 70% of responses were \"Accept\" or \"Revise\".
